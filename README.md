Documize Community is an open source, modern, self-hosted, enterprise-grade knowledge management solution.

- Built for technical and non-technical users
- Designed to unify both customer-facing and internal documentation
- Organization through labels, spaces and categories

It's built with Golang + EmberJS and compiled down to a single executable binary that is available for Linux, Windows and Mac.

All you need to provide is your database -- PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server or any MySQL variant.
