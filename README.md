## The mission

To bring software development inspired features to the world of documenting -- refactoring, importing, testing, linting, metrics, PRs, versioning....

## What is it?

Documize is an intelligent document environment (IDE) for authoring, tracking and delivering documentation -- everything you need in one place.

## Why should I care?

Because maybe like us you're tired of:

* juggling WYSIWYG editors, wiki software and other document related solutions
* playing email tennis with documents, contributions, versions and feedback
* sharing not-so-secure folders with external participants

Sound familiar? Read on.

## Who is it for?

Anyone who wants a single place for any kind of document.

Anyone who wants to loop in external participants with complete security.

Anyone who wishes documentation and knowledge capture worked like agile software development.

Anyone who knows that nested folders fail miserably.

Anyone who wants to move on from wiki software.

## What's different about Documize?

Sane organization through personal, team and public spaces.

Granular document access control via categories.

Section based approach to document construction.

Reusable templates and content blocks.

Documentation related tasking and delegation.

Integrations for embedding SaaS data within documents, zero add-on/marketplace fees.

## What does it look like?

All spaces.
