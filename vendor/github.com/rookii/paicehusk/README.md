##Golang Implementation of the Paice/Husk stemming algorithm
This project was created for the [QUT](http://www.qut.edu.au/ "Queensland University of Technology") course [INB344](http://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit-search/unit?unitCode=INB344&idunit=43393). Details on the algorithm can be found [here](http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/stemming/Links/paice.htm "Lancaster School of Computing"). This implementation is primarily based on the [ANSI C Implementationn](http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/stemming/Links/implementations.htm) by Andy Stark. Effort has been put into the correctness of the algorithm, but this is hampered by many of the existing implementations giving differing results. Any comments/assistance/pull-requests are welcome.

##TODO
* Benchmarks

##Demo
A demo App Engine project utilizing this package exists [here](http://paicehusk.appspot.com/).
